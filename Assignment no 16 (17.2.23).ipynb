    "     querying and indexing that you need.\n",
    "      It is also a data platform for developers that provides the services and tools necessary to \n",
    "     build distributed applications fast, at the performance and scale users demand.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns \n",
    "     found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model\n",
    "     that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable. While the SQL server \n",
    "     supports JOIN and Global transactions, MongoDB does not. The MS SQL server does not accommodate \n",
    "     large amounts of data, however MongoDB does. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when \n",

    "\"\"\"Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "    MongoDB is a scalable, flexible NoSQL document database platform designed to overcome the \n",
    "    relational databases approach and the limitations of other NoSQL solutions. MongoDB is well known\n",
    "    for its horizontal scaling and load balancing capabilities, which has given application developers\n",
    "    an unprecedented level of flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB’s top five technical features:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Ad-hoc queries for optimized, real-time analytics designing the schema of a database, it is \n",
    "    impossible to know in advance all the queries that will be performed by end users. An ad-hoc \n",
    "    query is a short-lived command whose value depends on a variable. Each time an ad hoc query is \n",
    "    executed, the result may be different, depending on the variables in question.\n",
    "        Optimizing the way in which ad-hoc queries are handled can make a significant difference at scale,\n",
    "    when thousands to millions of variables may need to be considered. This is why MongoDB, a \n",
    "    document-oriented, flexible schema database, stands apart as the cloud database platform of choice\n",
    "    for enterprise applications that require real-time analytics. With ad-hoc query support that \n",
    "    allows developers to update ad-hoc queries in real time, the improvement in performance can be \n",
    "    game-changing.\n",
    "        MongoDB supports field queries, range queries, and regular expression searches. Queries can \n",
    "    return specific fields and also account for user-defined functions. This is made possible because \n",
    "    MongoDB indexes BSON documents and uses the MongoDB Query Language (MQL).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Indexing appropriately for better query executions \n",
    "        In our experience, the number one issue that many technical support teams fail to address \n",
    "    with their users is indexing. Done right, indexes are intended to improve search speed and \n",
    "    performance. A failure to properly define appropriate indices can and usually will lead to a \n",
    "    myriad of accessibility issues, such as problems with query execution and load balancing.\n",
    "        Without the right indices, a database is forced to scan documents one by one to identify the \n",
    "    ones that match the query statement. But if an appropriate index exists for each query, user \n",
    "    requests can be optimally executed by the server. MongoDB offers a broad range of indices and \n",
    "    features with language-specific sort orders that support complex access patterns to datasets.\n",
    "        Notably, MongoDB indices can be created on demand to accommodate real-time, ever-changing \n",
    "    query patterns and application requirements. They can also be declared on any field within any of \n",
    "    your documents, including those nested within arrays.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Replication for better data availability and stability \n",
    "            When your data only resides in a single database, it is exposed to multiple potential \n",
    "        points of failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware \n",
    "        failure. Any of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible.\n",
    "            Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for\n",
    "        disaster recovery and backup. Horizontal scaling across multiple servers that house the same \n",
    "        data (or shards of that same data) means greatly increased data availability and stability. \n",
    "        Naturally, replication also helps with load balancing. When multiple users access the same, \n",
    "        the load can be distributed evenly across servers.\n",
    "            In MongoDB, replica sets are employed for this purpose. A primary server or node accepts \n",
    "        all write operations and applies those same operations across secondary servers, replicating \n",
    "        the data. If the primary server should ever experience a critical failure, any one of the \n",
    "        secondary servers can be elected to become the new primary node. And if the former primary node \n",
    "        comes back online, it does so as a secondary server for the new primary node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Sharding\n",
    "        When dealing with particularly large datasets, sharding—the process of splitting larger \n",
    "    datasets across multiple distributed collections, or “shards”—helps the database distribute \n",
    "    and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without \n",
    "    sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "        Like replication via replication sets, sharding in MongoDB allows for much greater horizontal \n",
    "    scalability. Horizontal scaling means that each shard in every cluster houses a portion of the \n",
    "    dataset in question, essentially functioning as a separate database. The collection of distributed\n",
    "    server shards forms a single, comprehensive database much better suited to handling the needs of \n",
    "    a popular, growing application with zero downtime.\n",
    "        All operations in a sharding environment are handled through a lightweight process called \n",
    "    mongos. Mongos can direct queries to the correct shard based on the shard key. Naturally, proper \n",
    "    sharding also contributes significantly to better load balancing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Load balancing\n",
    "        At the end of the day, optimal load balancing remains one of the holy grails of large-scale \n",
    "    database management for growing enterprise applications. Properly distributing millions of client \n",
    "    requests to hundreds or thousands of servers can lead to a noticeable (and much appreciated) \n",
    "    difference in performance.\n",
    "        Fortunately, via horizontal scaling features like replication and sharding, MongoDB supports \n",
    "    large-scale load balancing. The platform can handle multiple concurrent read and write requests \n",
    "    for the same data with best-in-class concurrency control and locking protocols that ensure data \n",
    "    consistency. There’s no need to add an external load balancer—MongoDB ensures that each and every \n",
    "    user has a consistent view and quality experience with the data they need to access.\n",
    "    \n",
