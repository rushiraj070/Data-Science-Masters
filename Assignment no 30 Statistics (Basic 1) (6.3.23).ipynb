    "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Statistics have majorly categorised into two types:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "            In this type of statistics, the data is summarised through the given observations. The summarisation is one from a \n",
    "        sample of population using parameters such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Descriptive statistics is a way to organise, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs, \n",
    "        and summary measures. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, the collection of people in a city using the internet or using Television.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Descriptive statistics are also categorised into four different categories:\n",
    "                a. Measure of frequency\n",
    "                b. Measure of dispersion\n",
    "                c. Measure of central tendency\n",
    "                d. Measure of position\n",
    "\n",
    "            The frequency measurement displays the number of times a particular data occurs. Range, Variance, Standard Deviation \n",
    "        are measures of dispersion. It identifies the spread of data. Central tendencies are the mean, median and mode of the \n",
    "        data. And the measure of position describes the percentile and quartile ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "    This type of statistics is used to interpret the meaning of Descriptive statistics. That means once the data has been \n",
    "collected, analysed and summarised then we use these stats to describe the meaning of the collected data. Or we can \n",
    "say, it is used to draw conclusions from the data that depends on random variations such as observational errors, sampling variation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inferential Statistics is a method that allows us to use information collected from a sample to make decisions, \n",
    "predictions or inferences from a population. It grants us permission to give statements that goes beyond the available\n",
    "data or information. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, deriving estimates from hypothetical research."

    "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of\n",
    "each type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "        The data is classified into majorly two categories:\n",
    "            1. Quantitative Data\n",
    "            2. Qualitative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us discuss the different types of data in Statistics herewith examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantitative or Numerical Data\n",
    "        Quantitative data is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often,\n",
    "    how many). Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are \n",
    "    height, length, size, weight, and so on. The quantitative data can be classified into two different types based on the data\n",
    "    sets. The two different classifications of numerical data are \n",
    "        \n",
    "        a. Discrete data\n",
    "        b. Continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Discrete Data\n",
    "        Discrete data can take only discrete values. Discrete information contains only a finite number of possible values. \n",
    "    Those values cannot be subdivided meaningfully. Here, things can be counted in whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Number of students in the class\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Continuous Data\n",
    "        Continuous data is data that can be calculated. It has an infinite number of probable values that can be selected \n",
    "    within a given specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Temperature range\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Qualitative or Categorical Data\n",
    "        Qualitative data, also known as the categorical data, describes the data that fits into the categories. Qualitative data \n",
    "    are not numerical. The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s \n",
    "    gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of \n",
    "    numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sometimes categorical data can hold numerical values (quantitative value), but those values do not have a mathematical \n",
    "    sense. Examples of the categorical data are birthdate, favourite sport, school postcode. Here, the birthdate and school\n",
    "    postcode hold the quantitative value, but it does not give numerical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Nominal Data\n",
    "        Nominal data is one of the types of qualitative information which helps to label the variables without providing the \n",
    "    numerical value. Nominal data is also called the nominal scale. It cannot be ordered and measured. But sometimes, the\n",
    "    data can be qualitative and quantitative. Examples of nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The nominal data are examined using the grouping method. In this method, the data are grouped into categories, and then\n",
    "    the frequency or the percentage of the data can be calculated. These data are visually represented using the pie charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Number of Blood Groups of Human-Beings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Ordinal Data\n",
    "        Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. The significant feature of the nominal data \n",
    "    is that the difference between the data values is not determined. This variable is mostly found in surveys, finance, \n",
    "    economics, questionnaires, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ordinal data is commonly represented using a bar chart. These data are investigated and interpreted through many \n",
    "    visualisation tools. The information may be expressed using tables in which each row in the table shows the distinct \n",
