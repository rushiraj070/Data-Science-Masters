    "        It is useful as the primary purpose of multiprocessing in Python is to improve the performance of a program by using \n",
    "    multiple CPUs or CPU cores.\n",
    "        Multiprocessing helps in performing parallel computing. There are several processors in a system, and each of them can \n",

    "Ans - While multithreading and multiprocessing can both be used to increase the computing power of a system, there are \n",
    "      some key differences between these approaches.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Here are some of the primary ways these methods differ from one another:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      1. Multiprocessing uses two or more CPUs to increase computing power, whereas multithreading uses a single process \n",
    "      with multiple code segments to increase computing power.\n",
    "      2. Multithreading focuses on generating computing threads from a single process, whereas multiprocessing increases \n",
    "      computing power by adding CPUs.\n",
    "      3. Multiprocessing is used to create a more reliable system, whereas multithreading is used to create threads that \n",
    "      run parallel to each other.\n",
    "      4. Multithreading is quick to create and requires few resources, whereas multiprocessing requires a significant amount \n",
    "      of time and specific resources to create.\n",
    "      5. Multiprocessing executes many processes simultaneously, whereas multithreading executes many threads simultaneously.\n",
    "      6. Multithreading uses a common address space for all the threads, whereas multiprocessing creates a separate address space\n",
    "      for each process.\n",
