    "Q1. Explain the assumptions required to use ANOVA and provide examples of violations that could impact \n",
    "    the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "    Following are the assumptions in ANOVA:\n",
    "        1. Normality of sampling distribution of Means - \n",
    "                The responses for each factor level have a normal population distribution.\n",
    "        2. Homogeneity of variance -                                 \n",
    "                These distributions have the same variance. i.e. σ1**2 = σ2**2 = σ3**2\n",
    "        3. The data are independent.\n",
    "        4. Absense of Outliers -\n",
    "                Outlying score need to be removed from the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Violations to the first two that are not extreme can be considered not serious. The sampling distribution of the test \n",
    "    statistic is fairly robust, especially as sample size increases and more so if the sample sizes for all factor levels \n",
    "    are equal. If you conduct an ANOVA test, you should always try to keep the same sample sizes for each factor level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        A general rule of thumb for equal variances is to compare the smallest and largest sample standard deviations. This \n",
    "    is much like the rule of thumb for equal variances for the test for independent means. If the ratio of these two sample \n",
    "    standard deviations falls within 0.5 to 2, then it may be that the assumption is not violated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      The one-way ANOVA is considered a robust test against the normality assumption. This means that it tolerates violations \n",
    "    to its normality assumption rather well. As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that\n",
    "    is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the Type I error rate. However, \n",
    "    platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small. This leaves you with two options: \n",
    "        (1) transform your data using various algorithms so that the shape of your distributions become normally distributed\n",
    "     or (2) choose the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test which does not require the assumption of normality.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      There are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been \n",
    "    violated: (1) Welch or (2) Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you could run a Kruskal-Wallis H Test. For most \n",
    "    situations it has been shown that the Welch test is best. Both the Welch and Brown and Forsythe tests are available in \n",
    "    SPSS Statistics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        A lack of independence of cases has been stated as the most serious assumption to fail. Often, there is little you \n",
    "    can do that offers a good solution to this problem.\n",

    "Q2. What are the three types of ANOVA, and in what situations would each be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - 1. One Way ANOVA\n",
    "        A one way ANOVA is used to compare two means from two independent (unrelated) groups using the F-distribution. The null \n",
    "        hypothesis for the test is that the two means are equal. Therefore, a significant result means that the two means are \n",
    "        unequal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples of when to use a one way ANOVA\n",
    "        Situation 1: You have a group of individuals randomly split into smaller groups and completing different tasks. For example,\n",
    "        you might be studying the effects of tea on weight loss and form three groups: green tea, black tea, and no tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Situation 2: Similar to situation 1, but in this case the individuals are split into groups based on an attribute they \n",
    "        possess. For example, you might be studying leg strength of people according to weight. You could split participants into weight categories (obese, overweight and normal) and measure their leg strength on a weight machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Limitations of the One Way ANOVA\n",
    "        A one way ANOVA will tell you that at least two groups were different from each other. But it won’t tell you which \n",
    "        groups were different. If your test returns a significant f-statistic, you may need to run an ad hoc test (like the\n",
    "        Least Significant Difference test) to tell you exactly which groups had a difference in means.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. Two Way ANOVA\n",
    "            A Two Way ANOVA is an extension of the One Way ANOVA. With a One Way, you have one independent variable \n",
    "        affecting a dependent variable. With a Two Way ANOVA, there are two independents. Use a two way ANOVA when you have\n",
    "        one measurement variable (i.e. a quantitative variable) and two nominal variables. In other words, if your \n",
    "        experiment has a quantitative outcome and you have two categorical explanatory variables, a two way ANOVA is \n",
    "        appropriate.\n",
    "            For example, you might want to find out if there is an interaction between income and gender for anxiety level \n",
    "        at job interviews. The anxiety level is the outcome, or the variable that can be measured. Gender and Income are the\n",
    "        two categorical variables. These categorical variables are also the independent variables, which are called factors in\n",
    "        a Two Way ANOVA.\n",
    "            The factors can be split into levels. In the above example, income level could be split into three levels: low, \n",
    "        middle and high income. Gender could be split into three levels: male, female, and transgender. Treatment groups \n",
    "        are all possible combinations of the factors. In this example there would be 3 x 3 = 9 treatment groups.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. Factorial ANOVA \n",
    "            A factorial ANOVA is an Analysis of Variance test with more than one independent variable, or “factor“. It can \n",
    "        also refer to more than one Level of Independent Variable. For example, an experiment with a treatment group and a \n",
    "        control group has one factor (the treatment) but two levels (the treatment and the control). The terms “two-way” and\n",
    "        “three-way” refer to the number of factors or the number of levels in your test. Four-way ANOVA and above are rarely \n",
    "        used because the results of the test are complex and difficult to interpret.\n",
    "            A two-way ANOVA has two factors (independent variables) and one dependent variable. For example, time spent \n",
    "        studying and prior knowledge are factors that affect how well you do on a test.\n",
    "            A three-way ANOVA has three factors (independent variables) and one dependent variable. For example, time spent \n",
    "        studying, prior knowledge, and hours of sleep are factors that affect how well you do on a test Factorial ANOVA is an\n",
    "        efficient way of conducting a test. Instead of performing a series of experiments where you test one independent \n",
    "        variable against one dependent variable, you can test all independent variables at the same time.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Repeated Measures (Within Subjects) ANOVA\n",
    "            A repeated measures ANOVA is almost the same as one-way ANOVA, with one main difference: you test related groups,\n",
    "        not independent ones.\n",
    "            It’s called Repeated Measures because the same group of participants is being measured over and over again. \n",
    "        For example, you could be studying the cholesterol levels of the same group of patients at 1, 3, and 6 months after \n",
    "        changing their diet. For this example, the independent variable is “time” and the dependent variable is “cholesterol.” \n",
    "        The independent variable is usually called the within-subjects factor.\n",
    "            Repeated measures ANOVA is similar to a simple multivariate design. In both tests, the same participants are \n",
    "        measured over and over. However, with repeated measures the same characteristic is measured with a different \n",
    "        condition. For example, blood pressure is measured over the condition “time”. For simple multivariate design it is \n",
    "        the characteristic that changes. For example, you could measure blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate over\n",
    "        time.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Reasons to use Repeated Measures ANOVA\n",
    "            1. When you collect data from the same participants over a period of time, individual differences (a source of \n",
    "        between group differences) are reduced or eliminated.\n",
    "            2. Testing is more powerful because the sample size isn’t divided between groups.\n",
    "            3. The test can be economical, as you’re using the same participants.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Assumptions for Repeated Measures ANOVA\n",
    "            The results from your repeated measures ANOVA will be valid only if the following assumptions haven’t been \n",
    "        violated:\n",
    "            1. There must be one independent variable and one dependent variable.\n",
    "            2. The dependent variable must be a continuous variable, on an interval scale or a ratio scale.\n",
    "            3. The independent variable must be categorical, either on the nominal scale or ordinal scale.\n",
    "            4. Ideally, levels of dependence between pairs of groups is equal (“sphericity”). Corrections are possible if \n",
    "                this assumption is violated.\n"

    "Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - In ANOVA, the goal is to determine whether there are significant differences among the group means. This is \n",
    "    accomplished by partitioning the Total Variation in the response variable (as measured by the corrected total sum of \n",
    "    squares) into two components, the Between Group Variation (displayed in the ANOVA table as the Model Sum of Squares) and\n",
    "    the Within Group Variation (displayed as the Error Sum of Squares). Comparing the sources of variability enables us to \n",
    "    evaluate the null hypothesis. Are the group means equal?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is important to understand this concept as a high-level example of ANOVA, consider testing the equality \n",
    "    of group means with bell-shaped distributions. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This means that, if we sampled data from each group, the sample mean would be highly similar to its true center. \n",
    "    If the within group variability were instead large, and the distributions overlapped, it's possible that the sampled \n",
    "    means could be highly similar. Then we are less certain of claiming that the means are significantly different. \n",
    "    Thus, in a nut shell, ANOVA simply compares the between group variation to the within group variation to either claim or \n",
