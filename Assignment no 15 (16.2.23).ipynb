    "'''Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "     Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. SQL is a realtional database which onlt deals with rows and columns on the other hand NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows \n",
    "     different structures than a SQL database (not rows and columns) and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     2. Working-\n",
    "            SQL databases are valuable in handling structured data, or data that has relationships between its variables and entities where NoSQL systems \n",
    "            allow you to work with different data structures within a database. Because they allow a dynamic schema for unstructured data, ther's less need \n",
    "            to pre-plan and pre-organize data, and it's easier to make modifications. NoSQL databases allow you to add new attributes and fields, as well as \n",
    "            use varied syntax across databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. Scalability-\n",
    "            In general, SQL databases can scale vertically, meaning you can increase the load on a server by migrating to a larger server that adds more CPU, \n",
    "            RAM or SSD capability. While vertical scalability is used most frequently, SQL databases can also scale horizontally through sharding or \n",
    "            partitioning logic, although that's not well-supported where NoSQL databases scale better horizontally, which means one can add additional servers \n",
    "            or nodes as needed to increase load.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4. Structure- \n",
    "           SQL database schema organizes data in relational, tabular ways, using tables with columns or attributes and rows of records. Because SQL works with\n",
    "           such a strictly predefined schema, it requires organizing and structuring data before starting with the SQL database.\n",
    "           NoSQL databases are not relational, so they don’t solely store data in rows and tables. Instead, they generally fall into one of four types of \n",
    "           structures:\n",
    "              (a) Column-oriented, where data is stored in cells grouped in a virtually unlimited number of columns rather than rows.\n",
    "              (b) Key-value stores, which use an associative array (also known as a dictionary or map) as their data model. This model represents data as a \n",
    "              collection of key-value pairs.\n",
    "              (c) Document stores, which use documents to hold and encode data in standard formats, including XML, YAML, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) \n",
    "              and BSON. A benefit is that documents within a single database can have different data types.\n",
    "              (d) Graph databases, which represent data on a graph that shows how different sets of data relate to each other. Neo4j, RedisGraph (a graph \n",
    "              module built into Redis) and OrientDB are examples of graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "     5. Properties- RDBMS, which use SQL, must exhibit four properties, known by the acronym ACID. These ensure that transactions are processed successfully \n",
    "              and that the SQL database has a high level of reliability:\n",
    "              (a) Atomicity: All transactions must succeed or fail completely and cannot be left partially complete, even in the case of system failure.\n",
    "              (b) Consistency: The database must follow rules that validate and prevent corruption at every step.\n",
    "              (c) Isolation: Concurrent transactions cannot affect each other.\n",
    "              (d) Durability: Transactions are final, and even system failure cannot “roll back” a complete transaction.\n",
    "       \n",
    "              While SQL calls for ACID properties, NoSQL follows the CAP theory (although some NoSQL databases — such as IBM's DB2, MongoDB, AWS's DynamoDB \n",
    "              and Apache's CouchDB — can also integrate and follow ACID rules).\n",
    "              The CAP theorem says that distributed data systems allow a trade-off that can guarantee only two of the following three properties (which form \n",
    "              the acronym CAP) at any one time:\n",
    "              (a) Consistency: Every request receives either the most recent result or an error. MongoDB is an example of a strongly consistent system, \n",
    "                  whereas others such as Cassandra offer eventual consistency.\n",
    "              (b) Availability: Every request has a non-error result.\n",
    "              (c) Partition tolerance: Any delays or losses between nodes do not interrupt the system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "       6. Support-\n",
    "               Because SQL databases have a long history now, they have huge communities, and many examples of their stable codebases online. There are many \n",
    "               experts available to support SQL and programming relational data.\n",
    "               While NoSQL has quickly been adopted, it has smaller user communities and, therefore, less support. NoSQL users do benefit from open-source \n",
    "               systems, as opposed to the many SQL languages that are proprietary.\n",
    "\n",
    "       7. Examples-\n",
