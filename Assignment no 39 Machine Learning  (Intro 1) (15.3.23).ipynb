    "    multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm shift \n",
    "    in virtually every sector of the tech industry. \n",
    "        Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, or even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind. And from\n",
