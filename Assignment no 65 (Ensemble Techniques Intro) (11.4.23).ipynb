    "#### Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans-** Boosting is an **ensemble learning technique** that combines a set of weak learners into a strong learner to minimize training errors. In boosting, a random sample of data is selected, fitted with a model and then trained sequentially—that is, each model tries to compensate for the weaknesses of its predecessor. With each iteration, the weak rules from each individual classifier are combined to form one, strong prediction rule."

    "**Ans-** Ensemble techniques have two main advantages: \n",
    "1. **Performance**: An ensemble can make better predictions and achieve better performance than any single contributing model.\n",
    "2. **Robustness**: An ensemble reduces the spread or dispersion of the predictions and model performance. Ensemble methods are ideal for regression and classification, where they reduce bias and variance to boost the accuracy of models."

Ensembles can create lower variance and lower bias, and create a deeper understanding of the data. \n",
    "- Ensembles are an efficient way to improve model accuracy and help to address complex challenges in machine learning such as class imbalance, concept drift, and the curse of dimensionality. However, there is no absolute guarantee that an ensemble model will always perform better than an individual model."

    "#### Q7. How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans-** Bootstrap confidence interval (CI) is a method of inference about a population using sample data. It involves drawing samples with replacement from sample data and calculating the statistic of interest for each sample. The bootstrap CI is obtained by ordering the bootstrap estimates and taking the endpoints of the interval that covers the desired percentage of the estimates. Bootstrap CI can be used for statistics that have no closed-form or complicated solutions."

    "#### Q8. How does bootstrap work and What are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans-** Bootstrap is a statistical method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling the original data with replacement. The basic idea behind bootstrap is to use the data of a sample study at hand as a “surrogate population”, for the purpose of approximating the sampling distribution of a statistic; i.e. to resample (with replacement) from the sample data, compute the statistic of interest on each resampled data set, and use these bootstrap estimates to estimate the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n",

    "    - Calculate the statistic of interest for the bootstrap sample.\n",
    "4. Calculate the mean of the calculated sample statistics.\n",
