    "Ans - \n",

    "**Anomaly detection** is the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. These data points are referred to as anomalies, outliers, or exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- **Detect Fraud**: In financial transactions to spot fraudulent activities.\n",
    "- **Monitor Systems**: In IT and industrial systems to detect unusual patterns that might indicate malfunctions.\n",
    "- **Ensure Quality**: In manufacturing to identify defective products.\n",
