    "Yes, Ridge regression can be used for time-series data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to using Ridge regression for time-series data analysis is to first transform the time-series data into a supervised learning problem by creating lagged variables. This involves creating new variables that represent the value of each variable at previous time points. For example, if we have a time series of monthly sales data, we could create lagged variables for the previous month's sales, the sales from two months ago, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been transformed into a supervised learning problem, Ridge regression can be used to model the relationship between the lagged variables and the response variable (i.e., the current month's sales). The L2 penalty term added to the objective function in Ridge regression can help to reduce the variance of the coefficients and improve the stability of the model, especially in cases where the time series data has a high degree of autocorrelation."
