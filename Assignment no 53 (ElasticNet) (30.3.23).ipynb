    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages -**\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Feature Selection:* \n",
    "Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero, resulting in a more interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Handles multicollinearity:* Elastic Net Regression can handle multicollinearity, which occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, by shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Works well with high-dimensional data:* Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful when working with high-dimensional data where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Flexibility:* Elastic Net Regression offers a balance between the L1 and L2 regularization methods, which makes it more flexible than the individual regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages -**\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Computational Complexity:* \n",
    "Elastic Net Regression can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, due to the cross-validation and grid search process required to select the optimal regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. May require tuning of hyperparameters:* \n",
    "Elastic Net Regression requires tuning of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, which may be difficult to do in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Assumes linear relationships:* \n",
    "Like other linear regression models, Elastic Net Regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable, which may not always be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Limited to linear models:* \n",

    "\n",
    "#### *2. Imputation:*\n",
    "Another approach is to impute missing values with an estimate of their value. There are several methods of imputation, including mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation. Mean and median imputation involve replacing missing values with the mean or median of the observed values for that variable. Regression imputation involves using other predictor variables to estimate the missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *3. Modeling Missingness:*\n",
    "A third approach is to model the missingness of the data as a function of the observed data, and include the missingness model as an additional predictor variable in the Elastic Net Regression model. This approach can be useful when missingness is not completely random and may contain some information that is useful for prediction."

Choose a range of alpha and lambda values to perform a grid search over. Alpha controls the mix of L1 and L2 regularization, with a value of 0 representing L2 regularization only and a value of 1 representing L1 regularization only. Lambda controls the strength of the regularization penalty, with larger values of lambda resulting in more coefficients being exactly zero.\n",

    "#### *3.Fit the Model:*\n",
    "Fit an Elastic Net Regression model to the data using each combination of alpha and lambda values in the grid search. This will result in a set of models with different coefficients and different numbers of non-zero coefficients.\n",

This involves creating new variables that represent the value of each variable at previous time points. For example, if we have a time series of monthly sales data, we could create lagged variables for the previous month's sales, the sales from two months ago, and so on.\n",

    "Once the data has been transformed into a supervised learning problem, Ridge regression can be used to model the relationship between the lagged variables and the response variable (i.e., the current month's sales). The L2 penalty term added to the objective function in Ridge regression can help to reduce the variance of the coefficients and improve the stability of the model, especially in cases where the time series data has a high degree of autocorrelation."
